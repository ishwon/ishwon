‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á üôè

I'm Ish Sookun. I am a Systems Architect at La Sentinelle Ltd. In my free time, I am a Linux üêß enthusiast.
I contribute to the [openSUSE Project](https://opensuse.org), I'm in its Election Committee, I speak at its 
conferences and I maintain its [mirror](https://mirror.opensuse.mu) in Mauritius. Concerning mirrors, I maintain a few others as well ‚Äî 
details available at [mirror.cloud.mu](https://mirror.cloud.mu). I am frequent speaker at the annual 
[Developers Conference of Mauritius](https://conference.mscc.mu).

## AFRINIC Community
I have a keen interest in internet policies in Africa. Thus, I participate in disscussions within the 
[AFRINIC Community](https://lists.afrinic.net/pipermail/community-discuss/), especially the 
[Resource Policy Discussions](https://lists.afrinic.net/pipermail/rpd/).

## Mauritius Internet Exchange Point (MIXP)
Fast internet is cool! Low latency is even cooler. üòé

The aim of the MIXP is to encourage all network operators in Mauritius to peer and keep local traffic truly local.
I volunteer at the MIXP and maintain some of its systems/infra.

## Systems Engineering

I particularly love building email, DNS, LDAP infrastructure.

## Web Development

This is a totally new found love. Mostly into projects that involve the Tailwind CSS/Alpine.js/Laravel/Livewire (TALL)
stack. I also enjoy theming for [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) powered sites.
